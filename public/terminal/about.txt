Iâ€™m a data scientist and AI researcher specialising in natural language
processing (NLP) and machine learning at the Care Policy and Evaluation Centre
(CPEC) at the London School of Economics. My PhD research focused on applying
large language models (LLMs) to extract insights from adult social care
administrative records.

I work primarily in Python and R for machine learning, data analysis, and NLP,
with experience in JavaScript for web development and visualisation. My research
involves building and evaluating AI models that process complex text data,
ensuring they are both accurate and practically useful in real-world
applications.

Before moving into data science, I spent a decade in public services as a social
worker and later as a team manager. This hands-on experience with frontline data
collection and decision-making shapes my approach to AI: technical development
should be driven real-world needs, and even the most advanced models are useless
if applied without a clear understanding of the data.

My Social and Political Science degree at Cambridge sharpened my focus on
fairness in public services, providing a theoretical foundation that has
informed my work evaluating bias in AI models.
